In this project, i will implement some operating system algorithms using the Python programming language.
I will review and implement well-known operating system algorithms including FCFS, SJR, SRT, MCPU, MLFQ, Elevator, and Banker. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of operating systems' performance by examining and executing these algorithms in a Python environment and to improve my programming skills.

I hope this project will not only contribute to a deeper understanding of operating systems' performance but also enhance your programming skills
